FreeRADIUS 3.0.0 Mon 01 Jan 8:00:00 CEST 2010, urgency=medium
	Feature improvements
	* Documentation for upgrading from 2.x is in raddb/README.rst
	  Please follow it.  It will make the upgrade easier.
	* Moved configuration entries in radiusd.conf to make more sense.
	* Added the "integer64" and "ipv4prefix" data types.
	* Added RADIUS over TLS (i.e. RadSec). See raddb/sites-available/tls
	* Updated internal API to support new attributes and formats
	* Added code to send SNMP Traps.  See raddb/trigger.conf.
	* Added preliminary support for Apple's Grand Central Dispatch
	* Added provisions for raddb/dictionary.local, for local changes.
	  See raddb/dictionary for more details.
	* Added packet/s tracking. See max_pps in the "listen" section.
	* The %{} expansions and "unlang" conditions are now parsed at server
	  start. Descriptive errors are produced for syntax and format errors.
	* Casting is now supported for "unlang" comparisons.  See "man unlang"
	  e.g. <ipaddr>127.0.0.1 == Framed-IP-Address.
	* Direct comparison of attribute references is now supported.
	  e.g. &Foo == &Bar.  This avoids stringification of the attributes.
	* Direct assignment of attributes is now supported.
	  e.g. Foo := &Bar.  It also works for "octets" data types.
	* Comparisons of IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes are now supported.
	  The "<" operator means "within the prefix" for comparisons.
	* New sha1 xlat expansion (thanks to Alan Buxey)
	* Colourised log messages when logging to stdout.  Look for yellow
	  warnings and red errors.  Doing this will save you a LOT of grief.
	* If the PCRE library is available, use it (insted of the POSIX 
	  functions) to process regular expressions (thanks to Phil Mayers).
	* -xv now displays all the features the server was built with, and
	  the versions of the core libraries (libtalloc, libssl).

	Module Changes
	* Moved raddb/modules/ to raddb/mods-available/, and raddb/mods-enabled/,
	  following the examples of other projects.
	* Module "extra" configuration files are now in raddb/mods-config/
	  Each module has a subdirectory where it will place its files.
	* Moved "users" to raddb/mods-config/files/authorize
	* Moved "hints" and "huntgroups" to raddb/mods-config/preprocess/
	* Moved eap.conf to mods-available/eap
	* Moved sql.conf to mods-available/sql
	* Moved TLS configuration for EAP into a common subsection.
	  See raddb/mods-available/eap, tls-config section.
	* Added for MS-CHAP Change Password from Phil Mayers.
	  See raddb/mods-available/mschap, "passchange" subsection.
	* Added EAP-PWD implementation from Dan Harkins
	* Added connection pools for modules. This unifies connection
	  management which was previously different for different modules.
	* SQL now uses the connection pool.  See mods-available/sql
	* SQL now supports arbitrary Acct-Status-Types.
	  These changes are not compatible with 2.x.
	* SQL now has full support for SQLite.  See raddb/sql/main/sqlite/
	* SQLite supports auto-creation of new databases on server startup for
	  bootstrapping purposes.
	* LDAP now uses the connection pool.  The LDAP module has been
	  completely re-written for performance and simplicity.
	* LDAP now caches groups.  This makes the server much faster for multiple
	  group checking.
	* Removed all limitations on 253 octet attributes.
	* New rlm_idn module providing an expansion for performing IDNA encoding
	of internationalized domain names. (thanks to 'skids').
	* New rlm_yubikey module to validate yubikey OTP tokens.

	Bug fixes
	* All known bug fixes from 2.2.x are included.
	* Removed "addport" functionality.
	* Removed many unused or duplicate modules.  See raddb/README.rst.

	Internal / API changes:
	* All traces of the old build system have been removed.
	* clang is fully supported.
	* We now use "talloc" for memory management.  A number of new
	  features required this change.
	* Many internal APIs have been updated to use talloc.
	* Removed all limitations on 253 octet attributes.
	* New API for iterating over VALUE_PAIRs, in preparation for nested
	  attributes.
	* No new code should directly modify fields of a VALUE_PAIR.
	* VALUE_PAIRs contain pointers to DICT_ATTR instead of containing
	  attribute and vendor fields.  This is in preparation for nested
	  attributes.
	* Some protocol specific code has been moved out into proto_* modules.
	  More will come in subsequent versions.
	* Standardised internal logging macros.  radlog() should not be used.
	* Use OpenSSL hashing functions when available.
	* Server now builds with no warnings on most platforms.
	* New RADIUS encoder/decoder.
	* Added RFC 6929 "extended attributes", via the new encoder/decoder.
	* Added full WiMAX support, via the new encoder/decoder.  The old
	  code could not handle some unusual corner cases.
